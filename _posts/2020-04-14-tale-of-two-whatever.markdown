# A test post
Initially, I intended to use this post to experiment with Markdown, to see if _italics really do render like italics_, the size of headers, and things like that.

I also wanted to test adding a photograph to a post and the first  photograph below, of London, happened to be on my desktop. I don't know why it was on my desktop. But the more that I look at it, the more that I think about the city's story in the 21st century so far: terrorist attacks, the silly William & Kate stuff, the 2011 riots, the optimism of the 2012 Olympics, the empty mansions of the global super-rich in Belgravia, Brexit, Grenfell, Boris Johnson with COVID.

One photo is not enough.

## London doesn't ask why you're there

And that is one, among many reasons, to appreciate it.

I can't help but feel a little sad for London post-Brexit, but it doesn't need my pity and anyway, who am I?

### London nostalgia

I took this photo of London on an early Sunday morning as the sun was rising. The scene evoked 'London fog' and British empire and an industrial Thames and so I decided to use black-and-white, as if to recall a dreamed past.

### London's cranes

But the city wasn't really like that. London was changing so fast, fueled by finance and real-estate, cranes everywhere. Everything was too expensive.

### The fire, the shame

By summer 2017, nothing felt more London, sadly, than the towering presence of the charred Grenfell Tower. Very early in the morning when it went up in flames, I remember smelling the smoke, miles away, through my bedroom's drafty windows. Strange, I thought, it almost smells like one of the neighbors is baking something, but shouldn't they be sleeping now?
