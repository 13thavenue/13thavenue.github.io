_An experiment rewriting Howl's opening lines_  

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by finance, working hysterical greedy, rushing themselves through long taxi queues at dawn looking for an extra hour,  <!--more-->
ambitious-browed faces searching for the strongest satellite connection to the endless fiber-optics in the technology of now,  
who 1 percent and bathrobes and tired-eyed and drunk sat up texting in the glaring blue light of luxury flats soaring above the streets of cities
contemplating costs,  
who revealed their want to Wall Street under the flag and saw Manifest Destiny popping up in gentrified shop opportunities,  
who finished universities with internships contacts now interviewing
Goldman Sachs and hedge funds successful friends with wealth experts,  
who were welcome to the chic restaurants with clients and credit cards eyeing wine lists and demanding more,  
who shouted in glass meeting rooms in sweat-stained shirts, plotting their profits in Powerpoint and ignoring the terror and teargas,  
who lost it all in minutes returning from Singapore with bad news for  investors in San Fran,  
who champagned in airports or drank dinner after Happy Hours, mute,

who jumped all hours to vibration beeps everywhere never there and humored the conversation in wherever anywhere, ignoring just enough to catch the essence of whatever,  
who texted continuously never looking out across the Hudson missing the strange moon entirely,  
lost automatons of monologue conversationalists ascending the lifts up to rooftops for self-images with city lights and dark skies,
fun imitating posting editing pretending truths and memories and histories and beauty still remove the blemishes and pain and shame,  
whole intellects consumed by creative destruction, lifestyle start-ups, with determined eyes, the elevator pitch poised for the boardroom,
who emerged from somewhere in New Jersey dreaming of tower riches gleaned from highways cutting industrial heartlands,  winning management praise and mortgage fixed-interest rates and business travel under debt forever in up-and-coming two-bedroom,  
who paced hallways up and down at midnight in the quiet dark wondering what to do, and after, forgetting the problem
